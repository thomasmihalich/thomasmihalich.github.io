### CPSC 120

* [Lab 10](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-10-arjun-and-thomas.git) I really enjoyed Lab 10 Part 3 as it first taught us how to output our code to an image. This was interesting to me because I had always been interested in how images are created from code into an actual picture we can open. It was fun using the RGB colors to make the gradient image that combined all the colors in one image.

* [Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-12-thomas-arjun.git) Lab 12 part 1 was one of my favorites as well. Similar to part 3 of lab 10, I had fun messing around with the colors in the animated gif format. Seeing an actual animated image that I created using code was really nice to see after figuring out the code. I specifically enjoyed the RGB value part.

* [Lab 11](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-11-thomas-m-and-arjun-d.git) Part 2 of Lab 11 was really fun for me as it took the Hi-Lo game, which is something we experimented with at the beginning, and made it much more advanced. I really liked the random secret number idea as it removed the necessity of the user implementing one themselves. This made the game very easy to use and one of my favorites to code.
